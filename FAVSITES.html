<h2>
<p id="facebook"> One of the sites I go to most often is <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and it's
a site where many people connect with each other through this social media platform. I started out on this website when it was still thefacebook.com</p>
</h2>

<h3>
<p id="reddit" style="color: red"> My absolute favorite website is Reddit. This a crowdsourced media outlet where people from all over the world post articles, pictures, humor and all sorts of online content onto the web. The content then is anonamously voted to the top of the page. The links with the most upvotes within a short period of time will be seen on the front page. There are posts that always seem to dominate the top and sometimes all I see are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aww"> cute animals </a>.</p>
</h3>

<p id="slickdeals"> Another site I go to very often is <a href="http://www.slickdeals.com"> Slickdeals</a>. I go to this site because there is a hole burning in my pocket all he time and I just want the best deals on the things I don't really need.</p>
